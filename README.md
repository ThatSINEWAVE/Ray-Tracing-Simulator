# Ray Tracing Simulator

![Ray-Tracing-Simulator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/966e9ae3-7142-4387-9586-4813881a08eb)

An interactive **ray tracing simulation** built with JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. This simulator allows users to visualize the behavior of light rays interacting with different objects, including reflective and absorptive surfaces.

## 🌟 Features
- **Real-time ray tracing** with adjustable parameters.
- **Dynamic scene manipulation** – add, remove, and move objects.
- **Multiple object types** – mirrors and circles with different materials.
- **Customizable light sources** – place and move light sources freely.
- **User-friendly controls** – tweak ray density, reflections, and length.
